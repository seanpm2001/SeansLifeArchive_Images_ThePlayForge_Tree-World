# Tree World 2021 December 27th session

## Sky glitch

<!-- Notes 2021.12.17
Sky glitch (own section in status file) occurs at branch 35-41, occurs only when scrolling down, resets once you go back down to branch 33, if you go slow enough, the glitch doesn't trigger
!-->

The sky glitch seems to occur at around branches 35 to 41, and only activates when scrolling down. It cuts the background out at this range, and only shows blackness. It resets once you go back down to branch 33. If you go slow enough the glitch doesn't trigger.

**Observations as of 2021, Friday, December 17th**

The glitch seems to also happen if you open the navbar of your device, even if you aren't scrolling in the game.

**This observation is as of 2021 , Sunday, December 26th**

## Critter duplication glitch

On 2021 Thursday December 23rd, I accidentally performed the critter duplication glitch by pressing the cancel button before it completely loaded. I got an extra Armadillo. I did not want to perform the glitch, I might evict the critter.

I started playing Tree World again today. Last night when doing research on the Play Forge company, this game caught my eyes, and I have now been able to confirm it was one of the older games I played back in my early childhood, for a decent amount of time.

Today, I focused on gameplay. I got my tree planted, and raised it up 13 branches. I rescued several animals, and made lots of progress. I had an extremely long session today. Originally, I thought it was going to be difficult to document and play, but it is really easy. The game wanted access to make phone calls, and I denied that. Luckily, it wasn't a requirement. They couldn't really do anything anyway, since my phones SIM card is completely corrupted, and no longer in the phone.

I plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Wednesday December 1st

I started playing Tree World again today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 15) and to expand to 16, I first have to feed the second tree egg for over 30000 tree food. I saved up over 10000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Thursday December 2nd

I played Tree World for a 3rd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 17) a lot of the time was needed to hatch the 2nd tree egg. Once I reached branch 16, all fruit collected doubled in value. I saved up over 1000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work even harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Friday December 3rd

I played Tree World for a 4th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 19) I did my first rescue mission today, I was forced to. I managed to quit early, as my battery ran low when I felt satisfied with my progress, so I was able to quit earlier.. - 2021 Saturday December 4th

I played Tree World for a 5th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a bit faster. I raised my tree up 4 branches (to branch 23) but did not expand the 23rd branch at all. I did my first rescue mission today, I originally decided not to, but decided to just go for it. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. I also used the critter capsule machine and got 1 free crit. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Sunday, December 5th

I played Tree World for a65th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. I did my third rescue mission today. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. My starter critters were unable to level up today, as I didn't play until the time that they were originally rescued 5 days ago. I started work on an open source alternative to this game today as well. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Monday, December 6th

I played Tree World for a 7th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I did not raise my tree up, and I had to quit before I could hatch the tree egg. I did my fourth rescue mission today. My starter critters leveled up today, I expected a massive amount of popups upon opening the application, but it was a lot better, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I earned my first vitagem from critter collection, and had a long session. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Tuesday, December 7th

I played Tree World for an 8th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 2 and a half branches. I did my fifth rescue mission today. My second day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I also upgraded the den twice today, the first 2 upgrades cost 5000 tree food each. After the first upgrade, I thought all the upgrades were going to cost the same or cost vitagems. After the 2nd upgrade, upgrades cost 10000 tree food each. I still don't have the exact pattern of costs nailed down, but the 12 extra slots I have will help me out, as I have been struggling to keep 1 species per branch.

Despite quitting early, I still had a along session, I just didn't drain my battery before quitting. I quit after a nearly 1 and a hakf hour session, I decided to quit. - 2021, Wednesday, December 8th

I played Tree World for a 9th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 3 and a half branches. I did my sixth rescue mission today. My third day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. - 2021, Thursday, December 9th

I played Tree World for a 10th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, but the game crashed once. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. When the game crashed early on, tree food wasn't collectable, and all the textures were glitched. I had to restart the app. I heard of a bug where sometimes the game crashes and tree food and vita gems are swapped. I cannot confirm this still, and it didn't happen following the crash. I did my seventh rescue mission today. My fourth day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. 

There were several things I forgot to mention yesterday, such as the fruit bonus increasing after reaching branch 30, and the fairy being unlocked at branch 30. The fairy is a paid option to auto-collect all tree food, but the first usage is free. I am unable to test it out further, and I don't feel like paying for it to trial it out yet, as I am saving up for other things first (as of today, I am 1 vitagem away from upgrading Pippy to level 3) 

Also today, I upgraded my den for a 3rd time for 10000 tree food, the fourth upgrade costs 20000, so the pattern broke again. - 2021, Friday, December 10th

I played Tree World for a 11th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. I did my eighth rescue mission today, rescuing a panda. My fifth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a shorter period of time, as I didn't have as much battery. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 1 hour 45 minute session. 

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy for free again today, and got a limited critter from a capsule opening. I upgraded Pippy with 75 vitagems, thinking it would be the last upgrade. There is a 4th one that costs 200 vitagems. I later earned a vitagem from critter collection. The sky texture is a bit glitched, and I am wondering what will happen once I reach branch 36, if it will stay like this or not. - 2021, Saturday, December 11th

I played Tree World for a 12th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today. I did my ninth rescue mission today, rescuing a sprite. My sixth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a shorter period of time, as I didn't have as much battery. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 1 hour 30 minute session. 

I got distracted with the family cat at the beginning, she was in my room, and I had to pet her, so I didn't play as much for the first 20 minutes.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy for free again today, and I tried out the paid use. Apparently, it costs 2 vitagems per use, so it is completely not worth it, and you should just use the free cycle once a day. The sky texture is still bit glitched, and I am wondering what will happen once I reach branch 36, if it will stay like this or not.

Today, I reached the most expensive tree keeper to date, it costs over 300,000 tree food to hatch. I got a little over 18% done getting up to this cost, but it is going to take me 1-4 more days to get past it. I unlocked level 4 plants today, and am now at 13.62% (41/301) completion on the discovery of all critters. - 2021, Sunday, December 12th

I did my tenth rescue mission today, rescuing a fox. My seventh day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a longer amount of time, but didn't completely drain my battery.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy (Patty) for free again (twice) today. I am still working on hatching the next tree keeper, I am over 62% done with it now. It will take 1-3 more days to save up for it. I did 1 adventure today, and got a duplicate critter. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only one was previously undiscovered. I also earned 1 vitagem from tree collection. - 2021, Monday, December 13th

I played Tree World for a 14th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK, I started much earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1.5 branches today. I did my eleventh rescue mission today, rescuing a boar (my 2nd one). My eighth day starter critters leveled up today, at first I didn't think they were going to, but I received the option later on. I played for a longer amount of time, and drained my battery down to 2%.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy (Patty) for free again (once) today. I hatched the new tree keeper today, and struggled to raise the tree up further due to how much I spent on the tree keeper. It took me 3 sessions to hatch this tree egg. I did 1 adventure today, and got a duplicate critter. Out of the 5 new critters I received today, only three were previously undiscovered. I currently have 52 out of 301 critters, totaling 17.28% of all critter types collected. I paired up more critters today. I considered coming back to play again once my battery charged, but I decided notto. - 2021, Tuesday, December 14th

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy at all today, and tree upgrades are becoming too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day.

Over 26% to next branch
!-->

I played Tree World for a 24th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was again repetitive, I started a bit later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today, it costs over 200,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I made it to branch 51 today. I did my twenty-first rescue mission today, rescuing a Seal (my 1st one). My eighteenth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 1 starter critters (to level 3) there was a ton of leveling up in the beginning.. I played for a long time (over 2.02 hours) and quit after draining my battery.

After creating branch 51, the price of creating new branches doubled, and now it is much harder to keep going, so I upgraded my den twice just in case. My tree was still completely full, and I couldn't place 3 critters. The first upgrade today costs 20000, then the second cost 35000. The next one will cost 60000.

I used the critter capsule machine today. I am over 26% there for affording the next branch.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only raising my tree up 1 branch. I did 1 adventure today. Out of the 6 new critters I received today, 4 were previously undiscovered. I currently have 86 out of 301 critters, totaling 28.57% of all critter types collected. - 2021, Friday, December 24th

I played Tree World for a 25th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was lesser, I started a lot later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.75 branches today, it costs over 256,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I stayed with branch 51 today. I did my twenty-second rescue mission today, rescuing a Stegosaurus (my 1st one). My nineteenth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 2 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a lot less time today, as I started with less battery, and quit after draining my battery.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy today, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, not able to raise my tree up a full branch. I did 1 adventure today. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, 3 were previously undiscovered. I currently have 89 out of 301 critters, totaling 29.57% of all critter types collected. - 2021, Saturday, December 25th

I played Tree World for a 26th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a bit longer. I started a lot later today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.25 branches today, it costs over 265,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I managed to raise my tree up to branch 52 today. I did my twenty-third rescue mission today, rescuing a Leafy Sea Dragon (my 1st one). My twentieth day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 3 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a bit more time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after draining my battery. I also upgraded my den for 60,000 tree food today, the next upgrade costs 100,000 tree food. I wonder if at some point, the upgrades are going to start costing Vitagems.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy at the beginning today for convenience, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 0.25 branches (1 branch) I did 1 adventure today. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only 2 were previously undiscovered. I currently have 91 out of 301 critters, totaling 30.23% of all critter types collected. I am considering not summoning new critters each day due to not enough space. - 2021, Sunday, December 26th

I played Tree World for a 27th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot longer. I started a lot earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0.75 branches today, it costs over 265,000 tree food to raise my tree up a single branch, so this new branch a day process is definitely slowing down. I stayed on branch 52 today. I did my twenty-fourth rescue mission today, rescuing a Zonkey (my 1st one). My twenty-first day starter critters leveled up today, along with my day 4 starter critters (to level 3) there was a lot less leveling up in the beginning compared to yesterday. I played for a bit more time today, as I started with more battery, and quit after draining my battery.

I used the critter capsule machine today. Today, I spent some time remodeling the first 20 branches of my tree, so that I would have 1 of each plant type. I plan to do the same for branch 21 to 25 when I unlock level 5 plants, then everything after that will be versatile in the future.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I used the fairy later on by accident, and tree upgrades are starting to become too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I was not able to do so today, only able to raise my tree up 0.75 branches. I did 1 adventure today. Out of the 5 new critters I received today, only 3 were previously undiscovered. I currently have 94 out of 301 critters, totaling 31.23% of all critter types collected. I am still considering not summoning new critters each day due to not enough space. - 2021, Monday, December 27th
