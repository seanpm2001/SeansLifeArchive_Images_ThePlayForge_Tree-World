I started playing Tree World again today. Last night when doing research on the Play Forge company, this game caught my eyes, and I have now been able to confirm it was one of the older games I played back in my early childhood, for a decent amount of time.

Today, I focused on gameplay. I got my tree planted, and raised it up 13 branches. I rescued several animals, and made lots of progress. I had an extremely long session today. Originally, I thought it was going to be difficult to document and play, but it is really easy. The game wanted access to make phone calls, and I denied that. Luckily, it wasn't a requirement. They couldn't really do anything anyway, since my phones SIM card is completely corrupted, and no longer in the phone.

I plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Wednesday December 1st

I started playing Tree World again today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 15) and to expand to 16, I first have to feed the second tree egg for over 30000 tree food. I saved up over 10000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Thursday December 2nd

I played Tree World for a 3rd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 17) a lot of the time was needed to hatch the 2nd tree egg. Once I reached branch 16, all fruit collected doubled in value. I saved up over 1000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work even harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Friday December 3rd

I played Tree World for a 4th  consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 19) I did my first rescue mission today, I was forced to. I managed to quit early, as my battery ran low when I felt satisfied with my progress, so I was able to quit earlier.. - 2021 Saturday December 4th
