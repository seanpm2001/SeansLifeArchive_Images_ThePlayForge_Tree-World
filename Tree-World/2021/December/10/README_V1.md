I started playing Tree World again today. Last night when doing research on the Play Forge company, this game caught my eyes, and I have now been able to confirm it was one of the older games I played back in my early childhood, for a decent amount of time.

Today, I focused on gameplay. I got my tree planted, and raised it up 13 branches. I rescued several animals, and made lots of progress. I had an extremely long session today. Originally, I thought it was going to be difficult to document and play, but it is really easy. The game wanted access to make phone calls, and I denied that. Luckily, it wasn't a requirement. They couldn't really do anything anyway, since my phones SIM card is completely corrupted, and no longer in the phone.

I plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Wednesday December 1st

I started playing Tree World again today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 15) and to expand to 16, I first have to feed the second tree egg for over 30000 tree food. I saved up over 10000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Thursday December 2nd

I played Tree World for a 3rd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 17) a lot of the time was needed to hatch the 2nd tree egg. Once I reached branch 16, all fruit collected doubled in value. I saved up over 1000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work even harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Friday December 3rd

I played Tree World for a 4th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 19) I did my first rescue mission today, I was forced to. I managed to quit early, as my battery ran low when I felt satisfied with my progress, so I was able to quit earlier.. - 2021 Saturday December 4th

I played Tree World for a 5th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a bit faster. I raised my tree up 4 branches (to branch 23) but did not expand the 23rd branch at all. I did my first rescue mission today, I originally decided not to, but decided to just go for it. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. I also used the critter capsule machine and got 1 free crit. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Sunday, December 5th

I played Tree World for a65th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. I did my third rescue mission today. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. My starter critters were unable to level up today, as I didn't play until the time that they were originally rescued 5 days ago. I started work on an open source alternative to this game today as well. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Monday, December 6th

leveled up several critters, expected mass popups, but it was a lot better than that

Long session

I played Tree World for a 7th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I did not raise my tree up, and I had to quit before I could hatch the tree egg. I did my fourth rescue mission today. My starter critters leveled up today, I expected a massive amount of popups upon opening the application, but it was a lot better, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I earned my first vitagem from critter collection, and had a long session. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Tuesday, December 7th

I played Tree World for an 8th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 2 and a half branches. I did my fifth rescue mission today. My second day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I also upgraded the den twice today, the first 2 upgrades cost 5000 tree food each. After the first upgrade, I thought all the upgrades were going to cost the same or cost vitagems. After the 2nd upgrade, upgrades cost 10000 tree food each. I still don't have the exact pattern of costs nailed down, but the 12 extra slots I have will help me out, as I have been struggling to keep 1 species per branch.

Despite quitting early, I still had a along session, I just didn't drain my battery before quitting. I quit after a nearly 1 and a hakf hour session, I decided to quit. - 2021, Wednesday, December 8th

I played Tree World for a 9th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 3 and a half branches. I did my sixth rescue mission today. My third day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. - 2021, Thursday, December 9th

Game crash, texture messup
MENTION SOME THINGS NOTED YESTERDAY
Branch 31, 32
Mission
Den upgrade 3: 10000, den upgrade 4: 20000 (breaks the pattern again)

I played Tree World for a 10th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, but the game crashed once. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. When the game crashed early on, tree food wasn't collectable, and all the textures were glitched. I had to restart the app. I heard of a bug where sometimes the game crashes and tree food and vita gems are swapped. I cannot confirm this still, and it didn't happen following the crash. I did my seventh rescue mission today. My fourth day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. 

There were several things I forgot to mention yesterday, such as the fruit bonus increasing after reaching branch 30, and the fairy being unlocked at branch 30. The fairy is a paid option to auto-collect all tree food, but the first usage is free. I am unable to test it out further, and I don't feel like paying for it to trial it out yet, as I am saving up for other things first (as of today, I am 1 vitagem away from upgrading Pippy to level 3) 

Also today, I upgraded my den for a 3rd time for 10000 tree food, the fourth upgrade costs 20000, so the pattern broke again. - 2021, Friday, December 10th
