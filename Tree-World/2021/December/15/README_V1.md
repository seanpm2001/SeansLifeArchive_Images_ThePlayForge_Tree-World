I started playing Tree World again today. Last night when doing research on the Play Forge company, this game caught my eyes, and I have now been able to confirm it was one of the older games I played back in my early childhood, for a decent amount of time.

Today, I focused on gameplay. I got my tree planted, and raised it up 13 branches. I rescued several animals, and made lots of progress. I had an extremely long session today. Originally, I thought it was going to be difficult to document and play, but it is really easy. The game wanted access to make phone calls, and I denied that. Luckily, it wasn't a requirement. They couldn't really do anything anyway, since my phones SIM card is completely corrupted, and no longer in the phone.

I plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Wednesday December 1st

I started playing Tree World again today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 15) and to expand to 16, I first have to feed the second tree egg for over 30000 tree food. I saved up over 10000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Thursday December 2nd

I played Tree World for a 3rd consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 17) a lot of the time was needed to hatch the 2nd tree egg. Once I reached branch 16, all fruit collected doubled in value. I saved up over 1000 tree food, then quit. I wanted to have a shorter session today, but it still dragged on for a while. I still plan to play again tomorrow, but I am going to have to work even harder on playing for less time, as I am also actively working on fixing my schedule lately. - 2021 Friday December 3rd

tree egg took a lot of time

Double the food from fruit

17 branches, multiple sessions, 5% battery

I played Tree World for a 4th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was still a bit slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 19) I did my first rescue mission today, I was forced to. I managed to quit early, as my battery ran low when I felt satisfied with my progress, so I was able to quit earlier.. - 2021 Saturday December 4th

I played Tree World for a 5th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a bit faster. I raised my tree up 4 branches (to branch 23) but did not expand the 23rd branch at all. I did my first rescue mission today, I originally decided not to, but decided to just go for it. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. I also used the critter capsule machine and got 1 free crit. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Sunday, December 5th

I played Tree World for a65th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. I did my third rescue mission today. I forgot how much tree food these missions reward. My starter critters were unable to level up today, as I didn't play until the time that they were originally rescued 5 days ago. I started work on an open source alternative to this game today as well. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Monday, December 6th

leveled up several critters, expected mass popups, but it was a lot better than that

Long session

I played Tree World for a 7th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was a lot slower. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I did not raise my tree up, and I had to quit before I could hatch the tree egg. I did my fourth rescue mission today. My starter critters leveled up today, I expected a massive amount of popups upon opening the application, but it was a lot better, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I earned my first vitagem from critter collection, and had a long session. I quit after a nearly 2 hour session, as my battery ran low, and I felt like doing more another day. - 2021, Tuesday, December 7th

A few level ups

Branch 27, tree egg hatched

I played Tree World for an 8th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 2 and a half branches. I did my fifth rescue mission today. My second day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I also upgraded the den twice today, the first 2 upgrades cost 5000 tree food each. After the first upgrade, I thought all the upgrades were going to cost the same or cost vitagems. After the 2nd upgrade, upgrades cost 10000 tree food each. I still don't have the exact pattern of costs nailed down, but the 12 extra slots I have will help me out, as I have been struggling to keep 1 species per branch.

Despite quitting early, I still had a along session, I just didn't drain my battery before quitting. I quit after a nearly 1 and a hakf hour session, I decided to quit. - 2021, Wednesday, December 8th

I played Tree World for a 9th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, and I managed to stop myself earlier on. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I hatched the 3rd tree egg today, and raised my tree up 3 and a half branches. I did my sixth rescue mission today. My third day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. - 2021, Thursday, December 9th

Game crash, texture messup
MENTION SOME THINGS NOTED YESTERDAY
Branch 31, 32
Mission
Den upgrade 3: 10000, den upgrade 4: 20000 (breaks the pattern again)

I played Tree World for a 10th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was better, but the game crashed once. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. When the game crashed early on, tree food wasn't collectable, and all the textures were glitched. I had to restart the app. I heard of a bug where sometimes the game crashes and tree food and vita gems are swapped. I cannot confirm this still, and it didn't happen following the crash. I did my seventh rescue mission today. My fourth day starter critters leveled up today, at first, it seemed like they weren't going to level up today, but they did, I just upgraded them manually, individually. I played for an extensive period, as I felt like doing so. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 2 and a half hour session. 

There were several things I forgot to mention yesterday, such as the fruit bonus increasing after reaching branch 30, and the fairy being unlocked at branch 30. The fairy is a paid option to auto-collect all tree food, but the first usage is free. I am unable to test it out further, and I don't feel like paying for it to trial it out yet, as I am saving up for other things first (as of today, I am 1 vitagem away from upgrading Pippy to level 3) 

Also today, I upgraded my den for a 3rd time for 10000 tree food, the fourth upgrade costs 20000, so the pattern broke again. - 2021, Friday, December 10th

Pippy upgraded 75 vitagems, now 200 vitagems for 4x crit

I played Tree World for a 11th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 2 branches today. I did my eighth rescue mission today, rescuing a panda. My fifth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a shorter period of time, as I didn't have as much battery. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 1 hour 45 minute session. 

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy for free again today, and got a limited critter from a capsule opening. I upgraded Pippy with 75 vitagems, thinking it would be the last upgrade. There is a 4th one that costs 200 vitagems. I later earned a vitagem from critter collection. The sky texture is a bit glitched, and I am wondering what will happen once I reach branch 36, if it will stay like this or not. - 2021, Saturday, December 11th

Cat distraction at the beginning
Up 1 branch
1 adventure
Extremely expensive treekeeper
A little over 18% to hatching it
Tried fairy out, it costs 2 vitagems per use, not worth it

I played Tree World for a 12th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1 branch today. I did my ninth rescue mission today, rescuing a sprite. My sixth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a shorter period of time, as I didn't have as much battery. I drained the battery before quitting, and eventually quit after a nearly 1 hour 30 minute session. 

I got distracted with the family cat at the beginning, she was in my room, and I had to pet her, so I didn't play as much for the first 20 minutes.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy for free again today, and I tried out the paid use. Apparently, it costs 2 vitagems per use, so it is completely not worth it, and you should just use the free cycle once a day. The sky texture is still bit glitched, and I am wondering what will happen once I reach branch 36, if it will stay like this or not.

Today, I reached the most expensive tree keeper to date, it costs over 300,000 tree food to hatch. I got a little over 18% done getting up to this cost, but it is going to take me 1-4 more days to get past it. I unlocked level 4 plants today, and am now at 13.62% (41/301) completion on the discovery of all critters. - 2021, Sunday, December 12th

I played Tree World for a 13th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK, I started much later today.. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 0 branches today. I did my tenth rescue mission today, rescuing a fox. My seventh day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a longer amount of time, but didn't completely drain my battery.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy (Patty) for free again (twice) today. I am still working on hatching the next tree keeper, I am over 62% done with it now. It will take 1-3 more days to save up for it. I did 1 adventure today, and got a duplicate critter. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only one was previously undiscovered. I also earned 1 vitagem from tree collection. - 2021, Monday, December 13th

I played Tree World for a 14th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK, I started much earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1.5 branches today. I did my eleventh rescue mission today, rescuing a boar (my 2nd one). My eighth day starter critters leveled up today, at first I didn't think they were going to, but I received the option later on. I played for a longer amount of time, and drained my battery down to 2%.

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I also got to use the fairy (Patty) for free again (once) today. I hatched the new tree keeper today, and struggled to raise the tree up further due to how much I spent on the tree keeper. It took me 3 sessions to hatch this tree egg. I did 1 adventure today, and got a duplicate critter. Out of the 5 new critters I received today, only three were previously undiscovered. I currently have 52 out of 301 critters, totaling 17.28% of all critter types collected. I paired up more critters today. I considered coming back to play again once my battery charged, but I decided notto. - 2021, Tuesday, December 14th

I played Tree World for a 15th consecutive day today. Today, gameplay was OK, I started a bit earlier today. <!--I only raised my tree up 2 branches (to branch 25) but it is going to take me a while to save up to hatch the tree egg. !--> I raised my tree up 1.5 branches again today. I did my twelfth rescue mission today, rescuing a camel (my 1st one, originally I thought I already had one). My ninth day starter critters leveled up today. I played for a long time, but didn't drain the battery down below 6%

Today, I had difficulty raising my tree up further. I did not use the fairy at all today, and tree upgrades are becoming too expensive to maintain 2 new branches per day. I did 1 adventure today, and got a new critter. Out of the 4 new critters I received today, only three were previously undiscovered. I currently have 55 out of 301 critters, totaling 18.27% of all critter types collected. - 2021, Wednesday, December 15th
