# Tree World Play Style and goals

This document goes over the way I play Tree World, and my gameplay goals.

## Tree World play style

Constant collection, as much tree food as possible.

Expand as much as possible.

Document new critters as they are unlocked.

Keep the den roomy, so that it doesn't become unmaintainable.

Keep the tree style as follows:

Branches 1-5: the 5 level 1 plant types (free)

Branches 6-10: the 5 level 2 plant types (500 tree food)

Branches 11-15: the 5 level 3 plant types (1000 tree food)

Branches 16-20: the 5 level 4 plant types (2000 tree food)

Branches 21-25: the 5 level 5 plant types (5000 tree food)

Branches 26-30: the 5 most expensive (8 vitagems) versatile plant types

Branches 31+: versatile (5 vitagems)

Keep gameplay on a daily basis, check in every 1-2 hours up to 7 times a day.

Do not trade critters.

Watch ads for vitagems when convenient

## Tree World gameplay goals

My goals for Tree World gameplay are as follows:

- [ ] Collect 2 of every animal

- [ ] Play the game as a free to play, and prove the game doesn't require money to play

- [ ] Generate tons of stock gameplay images

- [ ] Document every single step
