![https://github.com/seanpm2001/ZooTree/blob/main/Graphics/TreeWorld/Critter_Icons/critter_icon_limited-ipadhd.png](https://github.com/seanpm2001/ZooTree/blob/main/Graphics/TreeWorld/Critter_Icons/critter_icon_limited-ipadhd.png)

The Limited rarity is one of the 5 levels of rarity for critters in Tree World. It does not apply to plants. Limited critters are the second hardest to obtain, and are marked with their name in purple to indicate they are limited. Despite being 1 tier above [limited](/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_ThePlayForge_Tree-World/wiki/Rarity-Legendary) they are even easier to obtain than legendary critters.

There are 60 different legendary critters in the game. They include:

List | Incomplete
---|---
List is not | ready yet

Limited is the highest rarity in the game. There are no rarity levels above it. A limited is guaranteed each time you hatch a tree egg.
