BloomingStars are one of the 5 plants that are unlocked by reaching the 1st treekeeper. When a critter that likes flowers is placed on this branch, they give out an extra 5% in [tree food](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_ThePlayForge_Tree-World/wiki/Tree-food/) upon collection.
