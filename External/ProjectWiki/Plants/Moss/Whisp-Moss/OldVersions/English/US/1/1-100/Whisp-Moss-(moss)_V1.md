Whisp Moss is one of the 5 plants that are unlocked by reaching the 2nd treekeeper. When a critter that likes moss is placed on this branch, they give out an extra 10% in [tree food](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_ThePlayForge_Tree-World/wiki/Tree-food/) upon collection. Whisp Moss is a level 3 plant, and costs 2000 tree food to apply to each desired branch.
