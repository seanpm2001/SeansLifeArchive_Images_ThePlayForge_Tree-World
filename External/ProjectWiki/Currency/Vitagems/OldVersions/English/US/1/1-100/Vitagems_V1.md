Vitagems are the premium currency in Tree World. They are hard to get, and are designed to be purchased, but the game can be played without spending any money,

Vitagems can rarely be collected from your critters, but they can commonly be earned during adventures. They can also be earned from unlocking new critters, and completing certain quests. You can also watch 5 ads every 24 hours, each ad giving you 2 vitagems (10 vitagems total)

Vitagems can be used to instantly level up a critter, buy new critters, upgrade Poppys house, increasing the amount of critters she can summon at a time, adding level 5 and versatile plants to branches, and to unlock the fairy instantly (2 vitagems)
