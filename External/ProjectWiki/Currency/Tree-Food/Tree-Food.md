Tree food is the main currency in Tree World. Although it is mostly earned from collecting from your critters, it can also be earned from adventures, and quests.

Tree food is used to buy new critters, expand your tree with new branches, hatch a tree keeper egg, upgrade the capacity of your den, and to just collect.
